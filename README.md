建筑类型改为基础设施(与铁路相同，可以盈利)。为了避免ai过度建造和游戏平衡，增加了工具的商品输入。
修改了人矿生产中心的效果：消耗工具，大量产出橡胶，油。
为了加强肉类生产中心的人口控制能力，改变了建筑效果：80%劳工死亡率，增加征税能力，每一级增加3%地区死亡率，产出肉类，煤炭，油。

Update 11/5/2024

The building type has been changed to infrastructure (similar to railways, allowing for profitability). To prevent the AI from overbuilding and to maintain game balance, a commodity input for tools has been added.

The effect of the population production center has been modified: it now consumes tools and produces a large amount of rubber and oil.

To enhance the population control capability of the meat production center, the building effects have been adjusted: 80% mortality rate among workers, increased tax collection ability, a 3% increase in regional mortality rate per level, and production of meat, coal, and oil.
